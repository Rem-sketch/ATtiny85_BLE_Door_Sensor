# ATtiny85_BLE_Door_Sensor
BLE Door Sensor is a smart home IoT device that can detect the opening and closing status of either doors or windows. Sensor detects and sends a signal to the mobile phone via Bluetooth connectivity. It has the functions of a smart magnetic sensor, and an integrated light sensor in order to know the light index.
Component list: ATtiny85, HM-19 BLE module, Reed switch, and LDR sensor.
Feature : compact style  CR2032 coin cell powering  can deploy or mesh with other BLE network  double layer PCB  sensing door/window status of open/close and send payload to mobile phone.  sensing light index  have a RESET button
